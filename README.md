# Cocktail-Curator

Welcome to the Cocktail Curator! We've created a page to offer recommendations based on the temperature of the city you're searching, as well as the option to save those drinks locally to a list for you to refer to later come the opportunity arises.


Here is an example of the screen that you are welcomed with on loading the page.

After a search this is what will be like once returned.
